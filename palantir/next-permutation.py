"""
Given a number represented by a list of digits, find the next greater permutation of a number, in terms of lexicographic ordering. 
If there is not greater permutation possible, return the permutation with the lowest value/ordering.
For example, the list [1,2,3] should return [1,3,2]. The list [1,3,2] should return [2,1,3]. The list [3,2,1] should return [1,2,3].

1 2 3

[1, 3, 2]
[3, 1, 2]

[1, 3, 4, 9]
[1, 3, 9, 4]

1 5 2
2 5 1
5 2 1
